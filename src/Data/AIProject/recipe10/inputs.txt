Simple Shredded Pressure Cooker Chicken
Ingredients:
2 to 3 pounds chicken breasts
1 cup chicken stock (or water)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper
Directions:
Combine the ingredients. Add the chicken breasts, salt and pepper, and chicken stock to the bowl of your pressure cooker. Give everything a brief toss to combine, then arrange the chicken breasts so that they are spread out in an even layer.
2.  Pressure cook: Cover and set the pressure cooker lid valve to “sealing.” Pressure cook on high for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute natural release, followed by a quick release (carefully flip the valve to “venting”) to release whatever pressure remains.
3.  Shred: Remove the lid and use two forks to shred the chicken. Give it a thorough toss with the remaining juices in the pressure cooker.
Transfer it between two zip lock bags. Ensure there are some "juices" which will help protect the chicken in the freezer. Squeeze the air out of the bag. Label and place in freezer for up to 3 months.
If cooking from frozen, let it thaw in fridge for 24 - 72 hours first. Or let sit in water bath for 3 hours. Reheat in pot over low heat.
