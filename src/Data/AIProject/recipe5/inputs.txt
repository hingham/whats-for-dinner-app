Sweet Potato & Rosemary Shepard's Pie
Ingredients:
2 large sweet potatoes (about 12 ounces each), peeled and cubed (~6 cups cubed)
1 tablespoons butter
0.5 teaspoon chili powder
0.25 teaspoon fine salt
1 pound ground beef or lamb
2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
1 small green pepper, diced
1 small yellow onion, diced
1 cup mushrooms, cleaned and stemmed, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 ounces tomato paste
1 teaspoon chili powder
0.5 teaspoon dried rosemary
0.5 teaspoon fine salt or to taste
0.25 teaspoon black pepper
0.25 cup water
Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 375℉.
2.  In a pot with boiling water add diced sweet potatoes to a steamer basket and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Alternatively, bake the sweet potatoes until fork tender, 45 to 60 minutes in oven at 400F. Rub with oil and salt before baking.
3.  To make the topping: Place the peeled and baked/steamed sweet potato with all of the topping ingredients in a food processor (or blender) and process until smooth. NOTE: If using white potatoes, we recommend mashing them by hand rather than blending to prevent them from getting pasty.
1.  In a medium skillet, large cast iron recommended, over medium-high heat, sauté the ground beef, chopped carrots, green pepper, onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Continue cooking until the carrots are soft, about 12-15 minutes. Begin making the sweet potato topping while the filling cooks.
3.  Once the carrots are soft, stir in tomato paste, chili powder, rosemary, salt, black pepper, and water.
1.  Top the meat filling with the sweet potato mash. If you’re not using an oven-safe 10-inch cast-iron skillet, transfer the meat filling to a casserole dish or 9×9 inch baking dish and top the meat filling with the sweet potato mash. Sprinkle the top with a little sea salt and chili powder.
2.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375F. Remove from oven and serve.
Freeze in baking sheet. Cover with foil and seal in zip lock or plastic bag.
If cooking from frozen, let it thaw in fridge for 24 - 72 hours first. Then bake at 425F for 45 - 60 minutes until heated through.
