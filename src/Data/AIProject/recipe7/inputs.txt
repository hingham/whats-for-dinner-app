Healthy Chicken Enchiladas
Ingredients:

1.5 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cups cooked shredded chicken, about 2 breasts
0.5 cup frozen corn, thawed
0.5 cup cooked black beans
0.5 medium yellow onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
0.25 cup cilantro
0.5 teaspoon chili powder
0.25 teaspoon cumin
1 can enchilada sauce, from above
10 corn or whole wheat flour tortillas
1.5 1/2 cups shredded Mexican cheese, divided
0 onions
0 fresh cilantro, for topping (optional)
0 chopped green onions for topping (optional)
0 greek yogurt or sour cream, optional
0 avocado, optional
Directions:
1.  In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add oil and sauté garlic until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato sauce, oregano, chili powder, cumin, broth, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5-10 minutes. This will help thicken the sauce. Set aside until ready to use.
2.  Preheat oven to 400°F degrees.
3.  Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onions and garlic until soft and translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add chicken, corn, black beans, cilantro, chili powder, cumin and 1/2 cup enchilada sauce to the skillet. Stir to combine and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Remove from heat.
1.  Fill each tortillas with 1/4- 1/3 cup of the chicken and black bean mixture, a sprinkle of cheese and roll it up. Add 1/2 up enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan. Place rolled tortilla into the baking dish, seam side down. Once all the tortillas are filled, cover with remaining sauce and sprinkle remaining shredded cheese over top.
2.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the oven on the middle rack for 20-25 minutes or until cheese is melted and enchiladas are warm throughout. Serve enchiladas with your toppings of choice: green onions, fresh cilantro, jalapeños, sliced avocado and Greek yogurt and/or sour cream.
Freezer in pan. Cover with foil and seal in zip lock or plastic bag. Freezer for up to 3 months.
Cook directly from frozen to help tortillas hold shape. Cook at 425 for 40 minutes with foil. Then remove foil, check temperature, and cook for another 10 - 20 minutes until hot.
