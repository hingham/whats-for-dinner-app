Veggie lasagna
Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1 finely copped zucchini
1 eggplant (optional)
6 oz ricotta
6 oz low fat cottage cheese
3 cups fresh baby spinach
7 oz motzerella
1 cup finely grated parmesan
24 oz jar marinera sauce
1 clove garlic
1 box lasagna noodles
0
Directions:
1.  Heat pan. Add olive oil. Add chopped zucchini and sauté for 4 minutes. Add crushed garlic clove and sauté for an additional 1 minute. Add marinara sauce, stir, and remove from heat.
1.  Roasted eggplant adds some great flavor to this dish. And while it is an extra step, it is worth it when the dish is being prepared in bulk. To make the eggplant, preheat oven to 400F. Slice eggplant into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange on pan and brush with olive oil on both sides. Place in oven for 15 minutes. Flip then put back in oven for 10 minutes. Take out when eggplant is soft and well cooked. Set aside.
1.  Steam spinach for 2-4 minutes until fully wilted. Squeeze out excess water. Add ricotta, cottage cheese, and spinach to bowl and mix well.
1.  Spoon 1/3 of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange a layer of noodles on top. Then place 1/3 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the eggplant slices, 1/3 of the mozzarella, and 1/3 of the Parmesan. Repeat layer. Finally, add one more layer of noodles, the remaining sauce and mozzarella and parmesan.
Freeze it in ziplock bags for longer-term storage.
If cooking from frozen, let it thaw in fridge for 24 - 72 hours first. Or let sit in water bath for 3 hours.
