Baked Crispy Tofu
Ingredients:

14 ounce extra-firm tofu
1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
1.  Press the tofu: Press the tofu by wrapping it in paper towels (or a clean dry tea towel). Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books or cast iron pan on top of that. Let the tofu press for 30 minutes to an hour. I like to press a few blocks at a time on the weekend, then keep in the refrigerator for quick weeknight meals.
2.  Cut the pressed tofu into 1 inch cubes and add to a large bowl. Drizzle the soy sauce on top and stir gently with a silicone spatula or small spoon. Be careful not to rip the tofu.
3.  Let the tofu marinate for up to 4 hours. Less is okay.
4.  Sprinkle on the cornstarch and gently stir to coat the tofu.
6.  Cook in the oven: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spread out tofu on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with corn starch. Bake for 25-30 minutes until crispy.
7.  Serve warm or freezer for later.

Freeze it in zip lock bags for longer-term storage.
If cooking from frozen, let it thaw in fridge for 24 - 72 hours first. Or let it rest on counter for 2- 4 hours. Reheat in oven or frying pan with a bit of oil.
