Preheat oven to 375℉.\n2.  In a pot with boiling water add diced sweet potatoes to a steamer basket and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Alternatively, bake the sweet potatoes until fork tender, 45 to 60 minutes in oven at 400F. Rub with oil and salt before baking.\n3.  To make the topping: Place the peeled and baked/steamed sweet potato with all of the topping ingredients in a food processor (or blender) and process until smooth. NOTE: If using white potatoes, we recommend mashing them by hand rather than blending to prevent them from getting pasty.\n1.  In a medium skillet, large cast iron recommended, over medium-high heat, sauté the ground beef, chopped carrots, green pepper, onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Continue cooking until the carrots are soft, about 12-15 minutes. Begin making the sweet potato topping while the filling cooks.\n3.  Once the carrots are soft, stir in tomato paste, chili powder, rosemary, salt, black pepper, and water.\n1.  Top the meat filling with the sweet potato mash. If you’re not using an oven-safe 10-inch cast-iron skillet, transfer the meat filling to a casserole dish or 9×9 inch baking dish and top the meat filling with the sweet potato mash.

Shred: Remove the lid and use two forks to shred the chicken. Give it a thorough toss with the remaining juices in the pressure cooker.\nTransfer it between two zip lock bags. Ensure there are some 'juices' which will help protect the chicken in the freezer. Squeeze the air out of the bag. Label and place in freezer for up to 3 months.\nIf cooking from frozen, let it thaw in fridge for 24 - 72 hours first. Or let sit in water bath for 3 hours.
